# GPA
 The Console-Based GPA project is a Java application designed to facilitate GPA calculations for students through a simple command-line interface. The project consists of a set of classes that collectively manage the user's academic courses, grades, and overall GPA.Students can calculate their GPA from the beginning of their academic journey to current academic time . Also students can find out minimum letter grades they have to take per course to satistify probation limit.
 In the Conclusion , Students can see their GPA and Transcript , future possible curriculum and see mimimum letter grades they must take next semester to achieve the required status. 

 #Informations
1)Determination Of Classes In Undergraduate Programs:
Classes of the students are determined through the evaluation of the total credit requirement of the enrolled program and the total credits of successfully completed courses (with DD and over.)
Credits collected by the student in Faculties ;

29 and below: First class

Between 30-66: Second class

Between 67-99: Third class

100 and over: Fourth class

2) Probational Students

The minimum GPA for graduation is 2.00. The probational students repeat courses in order to ameliorate their grade point averages from course they have received F, FX, DD and DC; however the repetition of the same course is restricted after the first two semesters.

The students who cannot achieve the satisfactory status, repeat the courses they have received F, FX, DD and DC until they achieve the required status; however if there are no available courses for this status, they will be allowed to take courses in line with their course loads.

The satisfactory status is:

GPA=1.60 for students with 50 credits and less,
GPA=1.70 for students with 51-100 credits,
GPA=1.80 for students with 101 credits and more.
Credit means credits completed.
